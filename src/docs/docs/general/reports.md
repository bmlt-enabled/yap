# Reports

### What do missed calls mean on the reports page?

Firstly, an answered call is when a volunteer accepts a call and successfully connects to the caller.

A missed call occurs when a volunteer did not successfully answer a call.  In addition there was some record of either the call being rejected by a volunteer or no answer.
