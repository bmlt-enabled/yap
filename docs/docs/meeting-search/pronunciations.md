# Pronunciations

---

Sometimes meeting location names are mispronounced.  You can override this by specifying the original name (`source`) and a phonetically spelled version (`target`)

Example:

```php
static $pronunciations = [
    ["source"=>"Sequim", "target"=>"Skwim"],
    ["source"=>"Yakima", "target"=>"Yak-ima"],
];
```
