# Pronunciations

---

Sometimes the speech result of meeting locations may not be accurate based off the voice's ability to say it.  You can override this by specifying the original word (`source`) and the new word (`target`)

Example:

```php
static $pronunciations = [[
    "source"=>"Yakima",
    "target"=>"UkEEma"
]];
```
