Fork the yap repo [here](https://github.com/bmlt-enabled/yap) and send a pull request.  For testing locally, run the yap server and then use `ngrok`.  Grab the ngrok hostname that is generated and then use that in your Twilio settings.

You get an instant proxy to your local services to step through and debug.
