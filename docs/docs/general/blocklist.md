# Blocklist

---

If you want to completely block a specific number you can use the setting as follows (comma-separated).

Sometimes it's best to look at the Caller querystring value in your logs or the Twilio console to see the exact number being passed. The number should be in  [E.164](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164) format.

```php
static $blocklist = "";
```
