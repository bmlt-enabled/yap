# Language Options

---

There is a concept of language resource files.  You will notice them in the `lang/` folder.  Please open a ticket if you would like to contribute to translating to another language.

You can also override any of the language prompts in the `config.php` file. 

For example, say you wanted to still use English, but change the "city or county" prompt to say, "city or suburb".  You would do the following in config.php:

```php
static $override_city_or_county = "city or suburb";
```

You can see the full listing in the `lang/en-US.php` which always has the full latest listing of the voice prompts.

You can also change the spoken language accent.  There is a wide variety.  See the Twilio documentation for more details: [https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/say#attributes-language](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/say#attributes-language).  There are also some additional voices available here as well [https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/say/text-speech#voices](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/say/text-speech#voices).

An example would be using an Australian English Accent.  Set your config.php to:

```php
static $voice = "alice";
static $language = "en-AU";
``` 

### Language Call Routing

You can also create a language selection menu upon dialing in.  It will only be available for those that there are resource files for in `lang/` folder.  If you have some translations, please send them, so they can be merged in.

Add a new setting called, specifying the language codes for each language you want included.  The order will indicate the order in which it will be played back:

```php
static $language_selections = "en-US,pig-latin";
```

This example will make option 1, English and option 2, pig latin.

### Mixing languages and voices

Voices can be configured for every language option.  For example for Spanish:

```php
es_US_voice = "Polly.Penelope";
```

**New Yap 3.0** If you want to route calls to volunteers by language, see the section on Language in [Specialized Routing](../../helpline/specialized-routing/).
