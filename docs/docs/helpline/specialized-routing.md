## Gender Routing

**New Yap 3.0** Gender routing allows you to specify volunteers as Male or Female to enable callers to speak with volunteers of their gender selection.

This setting is configured from within each service body call handling.

## Shadow (Volunteer Training)

**New Yap 3.0** This feature allow you to set up volunteers as trainees or trainers.  If a volunteer is set as a "trainee" and they connected to a helpline call, a "trainer" (or multiple trainers), will all be called and added to volunteer call to listen in.  The trainer cannot speak, only listen.

This feature is configured in the administrative portal under each specific volunteer.

## Language

**New Yap 3.0** You can tag volunteers to zero or more languages (English is the default).  Be sure to set the list of languages you want your callers to be prompted with [here](../../general/language-options/).
