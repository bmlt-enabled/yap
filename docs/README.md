# Documentation

The yap docs website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/). Most of the docs live in the `docs/docs` folder.
The documentation is written in basic markdown files (md). A basic markdown cheat sheet can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

## Local Development

To install and run the website locally to view your changes while your making them you will need to do the following.

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

After installing you can then run.

```
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Deployment

The website is hosted as a github page and is deployed upon merges to master.
